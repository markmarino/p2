## Description
xkcd style password generator. my slant on this was to make a password generator with a special dictionary of words from song titles from the band Clutch. The other novel feature I added was an option to convert the words to "leet speak" to make the passwords even harder to brute force crack (and to add some nerd-sauce to the recipe).

## Demo

## Details for teaching team
I started off with the example front end code at http://p2.dwa15.com/ and then wrote my back-end code to meet the basic requirements for P2 before extending the functinality.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
